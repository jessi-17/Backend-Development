Synchronous Javascript:
1. executes code sequentially, one task at a time.
2. each task wait for the previous one to finish before the next task can begin.

simply saying jab tak ek task complete nah ho , dusra shuru nhi ho sakta.
example:- 
task a - 5 we will wait for 5 sec and then it will execute
task b - 2
task c - 15


Asynchronous javascript:
1. allows task to run in the background, without blocking the execution of subsequent task.
2. uses constructs like callbacks, sysnc/awaits to handle task that take time.

aur asynch mai matlab sarre task ek sath shuru kardo,jiska answer pehle aajaye uska jawaab dena

total time taken would be less in the geiven example in synch it will be 23sec but in asynch it goes less upto 15 sec
thsings that we mostly use  to write asynchronou code is: 
settimeout
setinterval
fetch
xmlhttprequest
promises
axios
all of these are used in asycnh code and for runingn this actually we use them with 
callbacks
ten catch
async/await
example:- 
async function abcd(){
    await fetch(``);
}
instead of .then we can just add await

id not this then it is synchronous code
 main motive is ke when we dont knwo how much time arequest to server gonna tke to reply to that request so we use asyn code to execute the rest of the code as it is but still when the request id done the output should be visible.


setTimeout(callback,timeinms);
here callback fucntion is the fucntion that runs after the serttimout given such asa after 10s the callback fucntion will execute


keep in mind that js is not asynchronous
