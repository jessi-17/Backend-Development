Synchronous Javascript:
1. executes code sequentially, one task at a time.
2. each task wait for the previous one to finish before the next task can begin.

simply saying jab tak ek task complete nah ho , dusra shuru nhi ho sakta.
example:- 
task a - 5 we will wait for 5 sec and then it will execute
task b - 2
task c - 15


Asynchronous javascript:
1. allows task to run in the background, without blocking the execution of subsequent task.
2. uses constructs like callbacks, sysnc/awaits to handle task that take time.

aur asynch mai matlab sarre task ek sath shuru kardo,jiska answer pehle aajaye uska jawaab dena

total time taken would be less in the geiven example in synch it will be 23sec but in asynch it goes less upto 15 sec
