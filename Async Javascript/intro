Synchronous Javascript:
1. executes code sequentially, one task at a time.
2. each task wait for the previous one to finish before the next task can begin.

Asynchronous javascript:
1. allows task to run in the background, without blocking the execution of subsequent task.
2. uses constructs like callbacks, sysnc/awaits to handle task that take time.
